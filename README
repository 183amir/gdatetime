           GDateTime - Date, Time, and Calendars for GLib/GObject
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of helpers for dealing with dates and times in GLib.  The
modules are broken into GLib and GObject where appropriate.

GDateTime
---------

  * For GLib.
  * Opaque type - Allocations occur on the heap.
  * Immutable - Operations result in a new GDateTime*.
  * Julian internally - Accessors are Gregorian, however.
  * Supports +-20,000 BCE.

GCalendar
---------

  * For GObject. GCalendar inherits GObject.
  * Various calendar implementations.
    - Gregorian
    - Julian
    - More are easy to implement
  * Calendars can be coded for various locales.  That way the default calendar
    matches the users locale.

And lots, and lots of tests!
