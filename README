This is an implementation of a DateTime, TimeSpan, and Calendar system for
glib.  To use the calendar support, you need to link against libgobject-2.0.

GDateTime
  * A simple DateTime opaque type that internally stores information in
    Julian period, julian day, and time in microseconds.
  * Default accessor methods return results for Gregorian calendar.
  * Accessors for julian information as well which would be used by
    most calendar implementations.

GTimeSpan
  * A simple calculation of difference between two points in time.

GCalendar
  * A GObject for doing calendar conversions
